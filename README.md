- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for remote opportunities to work with exiciting projects on .NET stack

------------------------------------------------------------
5+ years of industrial experience on .NET stack with Angular as front end.

Always try to maintain the SOLID principle and follow standard practices to keep the code clean.
Love to read about .NET project architecture such as N-layered Architecture, Clean, or Onion Architecture, and implement those architectural patterns based on the project requirements and their pros and cons.

Very much proficient in writing complex yet optimized and robust TSQL and Stored procedures in MSSQL.

Though love to work with the .NET stack, very open to new technology.

Always love to write articles about Technical and non-technical stuff.
